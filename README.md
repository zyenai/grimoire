# Grimoire
A digital grimoire containing tips, tricks, and TTPs. Omnissiah be praised!

This collection is meant to be read in a Markdown application like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). It is developed from the general perspective of a red team operator, with a particular focus on ICS/OT penetration testing, and is organized in alignment with the [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) taxonomy. It will serve well in situations where the operator needs to refer to certain TTPs or tool syntax but might not be able to access the internet on an engagement.
